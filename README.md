Studyphile â€“ A Study Planner Project

Introduction
Studyphile is a study planner project designed to help students organize and manage their academic activities in an effective way. The system allows users to maintain tasks, notes, reminders, and progress logs while keeping subjects and categories well structured. This project not only serves as a digital assistant for students but also demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming concepts using C++.

Features

1. Add, update, and manage study tasks
2. Set reminders for deadlines and important events
3. Maintain categorized notes for different subjects
4. Track progress and completed tasks with validation
5. Store user information including school or college details
6. Practical implementation of OOP principles such as classes, objects, constructors, operator overloading, friend functions, and inheritance

Technologies Used

1. C++ (Core programming language)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP concepts)
3. Git and GitHub for version control and project hosting

Concepts Implemented

1. Classes and Objects
2. Default arguments
3. Friend functions
4. Default and parameterized constructors
5. Static functions
6. Function overloading
7. Unary operator overloading
8. Binary operator overloading
9. Multi-level inheritance
10. Multiple inheritance

Future Scope

1. Expand into a complete desktop or web application with database integration
2. Provide graphical user interface for better usability
3. Add calendar-based scheduling and advanced notifications
4. Enable data storage with MySQL or SQLite for real-time tracking
5. Mobile application version for easy access anywhere

Conclusion
Studyphile is more than just a coding project. It represents how OOP concepts can be applied in a real-world academic management system. With further development, it has the potential to become a practical solution for students to manage their studies more efficiently.
